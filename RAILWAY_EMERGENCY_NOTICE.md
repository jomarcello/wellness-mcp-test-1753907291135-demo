# üö® RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT EMERGENCY FIX

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Railway API token has expired/become invalid

- Emergency disconnect workflow **FAILED** due to invalid Railway token
- All existing Railway services are **STILL CONNECTED** to GitHub repository
- Every push to main branch triggers **BULK DEPLOYMENTS** of all connected services
- This causes all leads to get deployment queues created on Railway

## Immediate Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

**ALL RAILWAY DEPLOYMENTS DISABLED** in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# Both deploy-single and deploy-auto jobs now have:
if: ${{ false }}
```

This **IMMEDIATELY STOPS**:
- ‚ùå New practice deployments via GitHub Actions
- ‚ùå Automatic deployments on push events
- ‚ùå Manual deployment workflows

## Current Status

‚úÖ **BULK DEPLOYMENT PROBLEM RESOLVED**
- No more automatic deployments will trigger
- Existing services continue running normally
- GitHub pushes will no longer cause bulk deployments

‚ùå **NEW DEPLOYMENTS TEMPORARILY BLOCKED**
- Cannot deploy new practices until Railway tokens are fixed
- Manual Railway deployments still possible via Railway dashboard

## To Fix Properly

### Step 1: Get Valid Railway Token
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/account/tokens
2. Generate new API token
3. Update GitHub secret: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Disconnect Existing Services
Once valid token is available:
```bash
# Run the emergency disconnect workflow
gh workflow run railway-emergency-disconnect.yml -f confirm="EMERGENCY_DISCONNECT"
```

### Step 3: Re-enable Deployments
```yaml
# Change back to normal conditions:
deploy-single:
  if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && !inputs.deploy_all }}

deploy-auto:
  if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
```

## Verification ‚úÖ

**Test that bulk deployments are stopped:**
1. Make any commit to main branch
2. Check Railway dashboard - should see NO new deployment activity
3. Existing services should continue running normally

**Success criteria:**
- ‚úÖ No bulk deployments on git push
- ‚úÖ No deployment queues created for existing services
- ‚úÖ All services continue running
- ‚ùå New services cannot be deployed (temporary limitation)

## Emergency Contact

If bulk deployments are still occurring after this fix:
1. Check Railway webhook configurations manually
2. Look for alternative connection mechanisms
3. Consider temporarily making repository private
